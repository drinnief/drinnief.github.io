<h1> Drinnie Francisco's Portfolio </h1>

<h2> Minecraft Sculpture </h2>

<div>
<p>In this project I was given a prompt to create a Minecraft sculpture on something with cultural significance. <br>
Which is why I created Hatsune Miku, She is a virtual idol and internet icon, starring in a plethora of music, art, and memes created by the Vocaloid community that is still active today.<br>
For this sculpture, I was focused on adding additional details, such as Hatsune Miku's headphone microphone and her iconic leek/green onion.</p>
