						<div style=margin-left:20px;>
						<p>It seems like my friends are moving onto another 
						part of the internet. I'm thinking of joining them... (｡´-д-) 
						<br><br>
						I did enjoy having my online life here, but Stagram is just so 
						much easier to post and be on!! But I’m sure gonna miss the 
						friends I met from these parts. 
						
						Hm, how about this. For my mutuals who KNOW me know me, 
						I will set up a link to my Stagram page BUT you must enter 
						a password relating to the stuff I posted!<br><br>
						
						<b>Here are a couple of hints!
						<br>
						<br>1. The password is in Camelcase “SoSomethingLikeThis”
						<br>2. The name of my little star
						<br>3. The first word of my favorite Vocaloid song
						<br>4. The total number of stamps I have across my site 
						<br>(the gifs + png with a stamp border!)
						</b>
						<br><br>
						Good luck figuring out the password!

					<hr>
						<div style=margin-left:20px;>
						<p>To be honest, as much as I enjoyed making this diary page, 
						I really don’t have much to talk about. (；-__-) 
						<br><br>Like most of my time is here on the web anyways lololol. 
						Eh. Maybe I’ll start doing more offline stuff in the future, 
						but for now, I’m right here! >:D

						<p>One of the best things that you can ever have in life is a pet. I love my doggie!! 
						She is so cuteeee. All she wants to do is play and cuddle. 
						Like yeah maybe we spoiled her hella and her affection 
						is a bit overbearing BUT ITS NOT HER FAULT. XDDD
						<br><br>
						Just yesterday we were playing fetch inside the house and 
						she was zooming so fast like a comet!! A literal blink and 
						you’ll miss her! That’s why she’s my little star Stella!
